# Introduction to Quantum Mechanics 

Here are a set of introductory notes concerned with the basic principles of quantum mechanics. 
Ideally, these notes, or rather "cheat sheets", would ideally be used in parallel with a more 
comprehensive dealing of the subject. 

Perhaps their main purpose is to act as a friendly reminder to the basic principles of quantum 
mechanics without having to trudge through the hefty textbooks. 

Each "cheat sheet" has an accompanying set of problems.
